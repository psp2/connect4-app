    This Connect 4 app is a logic-based game for all ages, playable either online or offline. There are 3 game modes: Connect4, Don't Connect 4, and Mayhem. For Connect 4, select a column to place your token in the lowest possible position for that column. Get 4 in a row, column, or diagonal line first to win! For Don't Connect 4, try to trick your opponent into getting 4 in a row first. For Mayhem, a random number between 1 and 1000 will be selected before each move. Your token will be placed as follows: (random_number % your column selection) + 1. Mayhem is a mix of math and luck, so have fun!
